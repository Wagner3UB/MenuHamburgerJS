Hello there! Welcome to my litle world!

This is a simple open/close JavaScript hamburger Menu.

⚠ ⚠ First of all, becareful if you will add the reset.css in your current work, it maybe interfere in your layout! 

- the "nav" part will be your hole menu, desk, tablet and mobile. I recomended this menu type only for portrait tablet mode and mobiles. So you will need add a mediaQuery to set the div .hamburger_box to be showed only under 768px

- you can set the width and height of the box menu on style.css under .hamburger_list ul

- you can set the position of the first menu element under .hamburger_list ul a:first-child
